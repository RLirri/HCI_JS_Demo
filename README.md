## Relationship Between JavaScript and the DOM

- JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages.
- DOM (Document Object Model) is a structured representation of a webpageâ€™s HTML elements, created by the browser.
- The DOM is not part of JavaScript itself but an API provided by web browsers, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate web content.
- JavaScript uses the DOM to access, modify, and dynamically update HTML and CSS on a webpage.
- Together, JavaScript and the DOM enable dynamic, interactive web experiences, essential for modern front-end development.
- Practicing DOM manipulation is a key part of learning JavaScript for building responsive and interactive web applications.
